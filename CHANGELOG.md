# 2.0.0-7 / 2014-03-09
  * [BREAKING CHANGE] node.isStatusNode() is now a function (was a property before).
    Added new property `node.statusNodeType`.
  * [BREAKING CHANGE] Renamed ext-awesome to ext-glyph
  * [DEPRECATION] Deprecated event `lazyload`, use `lazyLoad` (upper case L) instead.
  * [DEPRECATION] Deprecated methods node.lazyLoad() and node.discard(). use load() and resetLazy() instead.
  * [FEATURE] Added node.isUndefined(), isLoaded(), resetLazy(), load(), resetLazy()
  * [FEATURE] [ext-persist] Added option `expandLazy` for recursive loading (still experimental).
  * [FEATURE] [ext-filter] 'mode: hide' now works with ext-table (still experimental).
  * [FEATURE] node.makeVisible() accepts options, scrolls into view, and returns a promise.
  * [FEATURE] Sample xxl and bootstrap themes.
  * [CHANGE] nodeRenderStatus() is now implicitly called by nodeRenderTitle().  
    This also means that now all markup and css classes are finshed, when `renderNode` 
    is fired.
  * [CHANGE] Calling setExpanded() on a leaf node fires .done() (not .fail())
  * [CHANGE] Removing the last child node collapses the parent; lazy nodes become empty (not undefined).


# 2.0.0-6 / 2014-02-08

    (now the extension object requires a 'name' property)

  * [BREAKING CHANGE] Renamed `fancytree-focused` class to `fancytree-treefocus` (container only)
