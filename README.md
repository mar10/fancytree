Fancytree 2.x is the designated successor of DynaTree 1.x.

## Status

Alpha!


## Summary

Read [the docs](https://github.com/mar10/fancytree/wiki), [What's New] and [take a look at the preview demo].

Note: The API (events, functions, and parameters) are still subject to change!

One main motivation of this rewrite was a more consistent and intuitive API, so this is also a Call for comments: [let me know], if you have proposals for improvements on the API or architecture.

Seasoned JS programmers are invited to [comment] or participate ;-)

Have fun

Martin
